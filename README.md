# Kasm Server
This is a repository outlining how I setup a Kasm server, and why I set it up.

## Why Kasm?
<br> For many of us IT professionals out there who are just starting to learn, Kasm was the most cost effective solution for me to be able to launch VM's at will for virtually free since it takes advantage of docker containers to do this. All it requires is time, and if you dont have an old computer laying around, buying one that has a decent processor, 4GB RAM, and atleast 50GB of SSD will do. And we cant forget Ubuntu on that bad boy, Lets get to it.
- [<b>All original Kasm documentation can be found here:](https://kasmweb.com/docs/latest/install/single_server_install.html)
